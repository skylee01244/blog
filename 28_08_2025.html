        <h1>First Option Purchase</h1>

        <p>
            I had my eye open for the stock <strong>$OPEN</strong>, a real estate company which buys and sells homes. Considered to be a meme-stock to most, The hype had already started in July where the stock had gone up +468% in only 21 days.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, on Aug 5th, the earnings report for Q2 2025, in my opinion, was in the right direction but NOT strong enough and looked weak.
            My initial intuition was that the stock wouldn't go up much and the hype would die down. I thought there was not enough evidence and numbers to back up the stock price rising.
            As expected in the following days, the stock plummeted -28%.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, the stock starting rising. I initially, thought this was because of the retail hype and it would die down. However the stock didn't stop rising. 
            I was on holiday so I wasn't able to constantly keep an eye on the stock. 
        </p>
        <p>
            With the stock rising, I created a simple algorithm to let me know if the stock rose abnormally. As my guess was reasoning behind the stock rising was non-existent and it would go down when retail realised.
            On the 22nd of Aug, the stock rose 38% in a single day, this was clear it was due to hype as there was no reason behind.
            I was waiting on a signal to show that retail would start selling after realising the hollow reasoning in stock price increase.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the 25th of Aug, the stock dropped 9.38% and that was the signal I was waiting for. 
        </p>
        <p>
            As I expected the stock to go down. I was going to buy a put option.
