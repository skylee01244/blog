        <h1>Notes</h1>
        <p>- People are very poorly attuned to making decisions when there is uncertainty. Do you know the difference between risk and uncertainty? In the realm of risk you know the odds, but uncertainty is a poor bet as you are betting on something that you don’t know the odds on.</p>
        <p>- Once you realise something is happening, you can trade accordingly. Trades don’t have to start based on fundamentals, If you wait until you can find out the reason for the price move, it can be too late. “Invest first, Investigate later”A great Soros quote</p>
